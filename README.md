# Vityarthi-CSE-project
This project is a collection of Python functions implemented within a single Jupyter Notebook (ProgramCodes.ipynb). It serves as a comprehensive computational library primarily focused on Number Theory (primes, factorization, divisibility, properties of numbers) and Computational Mathematics (sequences, modular arithmetic, approximations).
